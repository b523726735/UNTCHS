Name Hawaii Note - Aegis 2

Interactability_Text_Line_0 An Aegis truck stopped our group today. They put handcuffs on one of us and the rest scattered. I was too scared to look back amidst all the gunfire. I don't even know how many escaped. I'm going to head back to our base under the turbines and wait for the rest to return. I hope I'm not alone now...
